# Sound It
My daughter is learning to read, and I'm learning to publish more of the toys I make.

This is a fun little app that breaks words up into graphemes to help kids sound words out.  It's certainly not perfect, nor is it technically correct, but it's been an interesting diversion.

Here are a couple of references I used for splitting words up:
- [List of graphemes](https://www.readingdoctor.com.au/graphemes)
- [List of phonemes](https://www.dyslexia-reading-well.com/44-phonemes-in-english.html)

Simply showing the words with gaps between clusters of letters was okay, but adding a few animations made it **much** more
appealing to my kids.  With that in mind I took a few minutes to experiment with [motion](https://motion.dev) and see what
I could do.

I took inspiration for the UI effects from:
- [Fancy](https://github.com/danielpetho/fancy)

Okay, splendid.  I'm positive I and some bots will be the only ones to read this, but I hope y'all find it entertaining.
